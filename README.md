Python web scraper that emails you the results it finds, i.e: should you attack in the game now or later.

To use:
0 - Open the libaries.bat file to install the necessary libaries
1 - Run main.pyw 
  [an error will occur if this is the first time running it - this is normal]
2 - Edit the newly created "senderDetails.txt" to have the sender's email on the first line and the sender's password on the second line
  I would recommend creating a new gmail account just for sending yourself emails through this program. Once you do that you will have to click on this link: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and click allow. This will keep your own gmail account secure.
3 - Edit the newly created "recieverDetails.txt" to have the reciever's email on the first line
4 - Run main.pyw again and leave running as long as you would like to be sent updates

Thanks!
