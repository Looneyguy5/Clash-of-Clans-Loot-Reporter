Python web scraper that emails you the results it finds, i.e: should you attack in the game now or later.

To use:
0 - Install the libaries from requirements.txt [Open the libaries.bat file to install the necessary libaries]
1 - Run main.pyw, I would recommend creating a new gmail account just for sending yourself emails through this program. Once you do that you will have to click on this link: https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and click allow. This will keep your own gmail account secure.
2 - Edit the newly created "senderDetails.txt" to make sure the sender's email on the first line and the sender's password on the second line
3 - Edit the newly created "recieverDetails.txt" to make sure the reciever's email on the first line
4 - Run main.pyw again and leave running as long as you would like to be sent updatess

Thanks!
